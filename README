Building:

   Easy with cabal-install, of course:

      $ cabal install epub-metadata

   Or if you have the sources:

      $ cabal configure --enable-tests
      $ cabal build
      $ cabal test
      $ cabal haddock
      $ cabal install

Why was this done?

   The motivation for this project grew out of my desire to take charge
   of missing or incorrect epub metadata in books I have purchased. I
   started out using the Calibre open source tools for examining this
   info. Limitations and incomplete implementation of those tools led
   me here to build a more complete implementation in the programming
   language that I love beyond all others.

Why didn't I just use existing solutions?

   - Calibre ebook-meta utility

      I experienced various problems using this software, such as:

      Incomplete and in some cases incorrect handling of tags that can
      exist more than once, particularly when they are differentiated
      using attributes according to the spec.

      Unable to display many fields in the OPF Package Document metadata
      specification. Unable to manipulate data that is represented as
      attributes of tags in the OPF spec.

      Astonishingly slow performance. A command-line renaming
      tool built with epub-metadata is more than 45 times faster
      at parsing and displaying epub metadata. I'm going to blame
      Python here for Calibre's performance. This has had a big
      impact on projects where I've been processing hundreds of
      epubs in batch operations.

      To be fair, an effort is being made in Calibre to work with both
      epub and Sony LRF book documents. That is going to naturally require
      a lowest-common-denominator approach. My focus here was to work
      with epub only, and support a large amount of the OPF specification.


   - epub on Hackage, epub E-Book construction support library

      The focus of this project seems to be with building new documents,
      not parsing existing files. And there is a specific attempt to
      do more than the metadata, to gather up the content and other
      metafiles that make up an epub for creation.

      Examining Codec.Ebook.OPF.Types, most of the metadata fields
      from the OPF Package Document spec are missing or aren't modeled
      thoroughly. I felt that to contribute to this project, I would
      have had to significantly rip up the types and redesign them.

      At this time it seemed like a better solution for me to
      start fresh with modelling the types and code to manipulate
      them. That said, I would be very interested in combining the
      epub and epub-metadata projects at some point in some way
      that makes sense.
