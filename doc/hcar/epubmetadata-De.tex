Library for parsing and manipulating epub OPF package data. Now with epub3 support.

\begin{itemize}
\item Added support for epub3 documents. This was done using a single set of datatypes, not specific to either epub2 or epub3.
\item Redesigned the book file querying API to be an edsl. Actions are to be combined together based on what the developer needs from the document.
\item Data structures to contain epub metadata ``sections'' were redesigned to no longer be nested. Part of this change includes a typeclass-based pretty-print API for displaying this data.
\item Documentation rewrites and additions, including a working code example in the API docs.
\end{itemize}

epub-metadata is available from Hackage and the Darcs repository below.
