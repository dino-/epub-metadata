[1] date is simpler than it used to be, I believe it means "when this book was originally written or created", and looks like this:

   <dc:date>2012</dc:date>

[2] modified metadata looks like this:

   <meta property="dcterms:modified">2011-01-01T12:00:00Z</meta>

-----
For general documentation:

- Try to explain what this library is for, from a high level

- Worth saying that the primary purpose is to extract and manipulate epub2 and epub3 metadata. And some limited support is included for the other portions of epub like the manifest, spine, etc.
