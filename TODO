- Figure out a common data structure that can hold metadata for both epub2 and 3

- Implement epub3 metadata parsing as a two-pass system. Gather up meta tags first into a map keyed by the id they refer to. During pass 2, look up relevant metadata for packing into the data structures.

- Separate sub-parts Metadata, Manifest, Spine and Guide from Package. Make these all basically equally-independent things that can be parsed for, as much as is possible.

- Better errors on parse failure, this will emerge along with more unit testing

- More unit testing

- Bring the remaining sections into the new code, parsing, testing and formatting. For Manifest, Spine and Guide

- Need to assess the API documentation from the top, add a whole lot more of it, and provide very clear examples of how to use this
