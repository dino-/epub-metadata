- Add new field for modified, which is that special meta tag (see doc/dev/notes)

- Rename tests to reflect epub2

- Unit tests for new fields in Metadata

- Work on parsing without any meta tag pass to start with

- Parsing epub3

- Refine for all metas, not just title

- Format ordering

- Figure out a common data structure that can hold metadata for both epub2 and 3

- Need more API docs. Detail the differences between epub2 and epub3 in the data structures, where the fields come from and which are only one or the other.

- Implement epub3 metadata parsing as a two-pass system. Gather up meta tags first into a map keyed by the id they refer to. During pass 2, look up relevant metadata for packing into the data structures.

- Separate sub-parts Metadata, Manifest, Spine and Guide from Package. Make these all basically equally-independent things that can be parsed for, as much as is possible.

- Separate some of the Metadata sub-types into their own modules, starting with Title. We've got some utility functions now for this, will help to clean it up some more.

- Better errors on parse failure, this will emerge along with more unit testing

- More unit testing

- Bring the remaining sections into the new code, parsing, testing and formatting. For Manifest, Spine and Guide

- Need to assess the API documentation from the top, add a whole lot more of it, and provide very clear examples of how to use this
