- May need to add a special function that will try to locate modified even in the metaDate field (which is what an epub2 might look like)

- Need more API docs. Detail the differences between epub2 and epub3 in the data structures, where the fields come from and which are only one or the other.

- Need to assess the API documentation from the top, add a whole lot more of it, and provide very clear examples of how to use this

- Separate some of the Metadata sub-types into their own modules, starting with Title. We've got some utility functions now for this, will help to clean it up some more.

- Better errors on parse failure, this will emerge along with more unit testing

- More unit testing
